Adeyinka Makinde | Writer: Boxing: Limbo Kings Adeyinka Makinde | Writer Wednesday, 30 March 2011 Boxing: Limbo Kings The recent awarding to Sam Peter of the ‘Interim’ heavyweight championship by the WBC following his points win over Jameel McCline brings to mind the less than satisfactory history of such arrangements. Aesthetically, such ‘championships’ have tended not to please the senses and sensibilities of fans, but nonetheless have been used over the decades by boxing authorities as a means of striking a compromise of sorts where a champion is unable to defend his title and his ‘outstanding’ challengers are given an opportunity to stake a claim to the title while anticipating that such title will revert to the winner in the event that a champion is unable to defend in the future. For instance, in 2006, Hasim Rahman was awarded the WBC’s interim heavyweight title after his victory over Monte Barrett and this was upgraded to the full championship following Vitali Klitshko’s retirement.. They are not new to boxing. A related species of the interim championship is that of the ‘duration champion,’ where a champion is inactive during a time of war or similar indisposition. For instance, when Sergeant Joe Louis was serving in the United States military during World War Two, the decision was made to fill the vacuum by anointing a so-called ‘Duration Champion’; an honorific duly bestowed upon Jimmy Bivins in 1943. Similarly in 1953, when featherweight champion Sandy Saddler was drafted into the United States military, the uncertainty of the length of his stay and his availability to defend his title, caused the boxing authorities to bill a bout held in Paris between Philadelphia’s Percy Bassett and Ray Famechon as being for the ‘Interim’ title. Bassett won, but ‘lost’ the title to one Teddy ‘Red Top’ Davis. Most official records, it should be noted, do not acknowledge this ‘title.’ There have been times when the announcement of an Interim championship has tested the patience of observers. For instance, when in 1967, light heavyweight champion Dick Tiger was trapped within the flames of the raging civil war between Nigeria and his encircled Biafran nation, many frowned and fumed at the haste of Robert Evans, the president of the WBC, in announcing that Roger Rouse would take on an opponent for the Interim championship if Tiger was unable to get to American shores before a ninety-day period had elapsed from his last defence against Jose Torres. That the so-called interim championship has been used as leverage in political chess games is beyond doubt. For example, the Mexican Jorge Arce ‘won’ and ‘defended’ his WBC ‘Interim’ flyweight championship even while the champion Pongsaklek Wonjongkam continued to defend his title. Yet, in its unadulterated and sincere application, it strikes a prudent compromise in falling short of awarding an available championship solely on the basis of a boardroom decision as occurred in 1978 with Ken Norton being named as heavyweight champion by the WBC on the strength of a points win the previous year over Jimmy Young for what had officially been a title eliminator. The impetus for this decision had been Leon Spinks’s decision to defend against Muhammad Ali in a return bout instead pitting himself against Norton, the designated mandatory challenger. Instead the ‘Interim’ concept arguably attempts to keep the fighting programme well oiled in frustrating circumstances such as in the case of Maskaev’s late withdrawal and the uncertainty as to when next he will again lace the gloves. Thus it has an advantage in enabling two active and presumably highly-ranked contenders to contest a title of sorts while serving notice on the incumbent that his title will automatically revert to the winner if he is unable to defend at a date prescribed in the future. The problem as ever is related to the politics of the moment. Are both of the contenders for such ‘Interim’ title truly the outstanding fighters of the relevant division? Or are they merely the favoured vassals of particular sanctioning bodies and promoters? On the other hand the temptation may be to dismiss the ‘Interim’ title as just another ploy symptomatic of the modern era of proliferated and sub-divided titles. And after all, it is one of the standard cogs of the promotional aspects that television and cable outlets are loathed to give time to fights which are devoid of the appendage of some sort of a title. Any title. In the final analysis, the concept of the interim championship clearly has its strengths in terms of its attempt to combat the potential devious or otherwise disingenuous prevarications of an existing champion and so forestall the likelihood of a championship descending into inertia. However, they have tended not to serve as the most auspicious of starts to title ‘reigns’. The Cleveland-based Jimmy Bivins would lose a 10-round decision to Louis in 1951. In truth, the ‘Duration Championship’ was a pretty informal and insubstantial tag aptly reflected by the photograph portraying a uniformed Louis fitting a paper crown inscribed with ‘Duration Champ.’ Saddler defeated ‘Red Top’ Davis in a unanimous decision when he got out of the army, while Ken Norton lost his first ‘defence’ to Larry Holmes. Hasim Rahman succumbed to Maskaev. And Peter, who was awarded the ‘title’ before his bout, was for all intents and purposes ripe for a valid stoppage before eventually getting through McCline. Whoever happens to be the opposition in his next bout, the historical record bodes ill for Samuel Peter.

Huynh Le Minh Tu, deputy director of the HCM City Department of Industry and Trade, said that with a population of more than 90 million and increasing living standards, the retail market will remain very attractive for foreign investors in Vietnam. “Foreign retailers optimising the shopping experience for customer retention and applying multiple sales process metrics will have a better edge to dominate the market,” he said. Given the digital transformation trend in the retail sector, many foreign retail businesses are constantly improving their technological applications for collection, storage, management and comprehensive data analysis, based on a solid, secure, flexible and self-operating cloud computing infrastructure, he said. Other observers have also remarked that the fourth wave of COVID-19 has pushed foreign retailers to diversify their sales channels instead of the usual primary focus on providing goods onsite to consumers. Last year, major retailers like MM Mega Market Vietnam, Central, Aeon, LOTTE Mart and Emart implemented cashless payment methods for both online and offline shopping. MM Mega Market Vietnam has started a multi-channel sales development strategy alongside completing its online sales solutions: website MM Click & Get; Zalo and Telesales. It also plans to launch an online shopping website for professionals with product prices and solutions designed for each specific customer. With the pandemic situation remaining unpredictable this year, foreign retail businesses will need to be well prepared so they can keep pace with the nation’s economic recovery, experts have said. MM said it will continue to invest and develop multi-channel sales, with its wholesale supermarket system implementing the Pick & Go software soon. Meanwhile, AEON Vietnam has said it would open more outlets in different locations with a variety of retail models, including shopping malls, department stores, supermarkets, convenience stores and specialised stores. As it does this, it will maintain its digital transformation process, especially focusing on promoting O2O (offline-to-online); developing products to meet customer needs and do more to boost sustainable development by promoting environmental protection and social responsibility. Furusawa Yasuyuki, general director of AEON Vietnam, said they aim to open 30 shopping centres by 2030 along with other models. The Republic of Korea’s Emart Vietnam Co., Ltd. (acquired by the Thaco Group) will put into operation two new shopping centres. Hirai Shinji, chief representative of the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) in Việt Nam, said the Vietnamese retail market remains very attractive for Japanese investors. Despite the impacts of the pandemic, retailers and non-manufacturing enterprises from Japan are expanding their business in Vietnam to take advantage of its young population and an increase in per capita income, he added. A recent JETRO survey found more than 55 percent of Japanese firms intend to expand their business in the country. According to the survey, conducted from August to September last year, more than 56 percent of the firms expect higher profits this year, and only 9.6 per cent think their profit will reduce. Modern retail distribution has faced huge hurdles over the last two years due to the pandemic impacts (changes in customer trends, human resources, warehouse operations and supply chain disruptions). Although the Vietnamese retail market experienced a low growth rate due to the pandemic last year, it remains a market with high long-term potential, experts have said. They have noted that over the next five to 10 years, the country will be a leader in Southeast Asia in terms of an expanding middle class, which is expected to grow by around 9.2 percent every year.

Each piece of our glass hardware is designed to respond beautifully to various levels of light, from natural sunlight to incandescent bulbs, creating a dynamic interaction that enhances both the glass and its surroundings. ________________________________________ Matching Glass Hardware to Interior Styles - Minimalist and Modern to Eclectic and Traditional The world of interior design is rich with diverse styles, each offering unique aesthetics and philosophies. Jazz & Riffs Hardware complements these styles, bringing versatility and elegance to any space. Minimalist Style Minimalism found its footing in the late 1950s art world, later influencing fashion, lifestyle, and interior design. This style emphasizes emotional clarity and tranquility by stripping away the non-essential, both physically and metaphorically. Spaces are reduced to the most basic and simple elements, focusing on straight lines, geometric shapes, and a monochromatic palette. Jazz & Riffs Hardware's Snow White and Stormy Black glass designs seamlessly integrate with minimalist interiors. Their simplicity adds to the aesthetic of essentials-only spaces, enhancing serenity and focus. The monochromatic tones of these hardware pieces beautifully complement minimalist environments that rely on whites, beiges, and greys to create a serene and tranquil atmosphere. Modern Style Modern interior design is timeless and forms the foundation for many of today's most popular looks. Emerging in the early 20th century as part of the Modernist art movement, it breaks away from traditional forms and conventions. Architects and designers like Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe pioneered this style, promoting clean lines and the absence of unnecessary details. Jazz & Riffs Hardware reflects this ethos with long pull designs that echo the elegance of Modernist principles. Our timeless color options complement modern interiors, serving as foundational hues for any palette. The sleek, functional designs resonate with the enduring appeal of modern spaces. Eclectic Style Eclectic design harmoniously blends varied elements, creating a unique and personalized aesthetic. Over 30% of homeowners express a keen interest in incorporating eclectic elements into their spaces, highlighting the style's adaptability and charm. Jazz & Riffs Hardware embraces eclecticism with its bold 'Square Pulls,' available in 11 colors. Whether featuring the jazz-stacked glass or the smooth, ribbed riffs designs, these pulls and knobs make statement pieces that bring diverse design elements together. This collection allows homeowners to express individuality while maintaining cohesiveness. Traditional Style Rooted in 18th- and 19th-century European decor, traditional interior design evolves subtly to incorporate modern elements. Features like large kitchen islands and expanded cabinetry call for versatile hardware options. Jazz & Riffs Hardware meets these demands with its mix-and-match capabilities. Offering various sizes and styles, our glass hardware provides bold color options to create a classic yet updated 'traditional' look. This flexibility aligns perfectly with transitional style, blending traditional and contemporary elements into a harmonious whole. ________________________________________ Jazz & Riffs Hardware is more than just a functional element in your space; it's a design statement. Our versatile glass hardware adapts beautifully to diverse interior styles, enhancing the aesthetics of kitchens, bathrooms, and closets while responding dynamically to light. Whether you're designing for minimalism, modernity, eclectic charm, or traditional elegance, Jazz & Riffs Hardware delivers style and substance to every project.

The Death of a Marriage | Amy Waterman Toggle navigation Home Bio Books Interviews Dating Marriage Contact The Death of a Marriage Posted on November 26, 2017 “Our marriage ended when I lost respect for my husband,” Jan said thoughtfully. “I loved that man so much. I admired him and respected him and thought the world of him. To me, he was like a movie star and a sage all rolled together. I felt so lucky to be with him. “It took years of battering and beating before that halo fell off his head. If he hadn’t treated me the way he did, I’d still be with him, thinking the sun shone out of his … you know.” I knew. Many stories have been told about why marriages die. Some believe it’s because both people stop trying, or the novelty is gone, or they don’t have the right communication skills. But I believe there’s another story. It’s a story about the loss of respect. When you lose respect for one another, that really is the beginning of the end. That’s when the Four Horsemen rear their heads—contempt, criticism, stonewalling, and defensiveness. You lose your inhibitions. You start saying things that are deliberately cruel. You don’t feel any need to impress one another. You stop treading softly around each other’s tender places. Many couples stay together until the bitter end, despising one another. You can remain married to someone you don’t respect. But there’s a funny thing: When someone doesn’t respect you, it’s hard to respect them. That’s what Jan was referring to. She thought that nothing could shake her belief in her spouse, until he started treating her like a servant instead of his queen. He mocked her, excluded her, and seemed embarrassed of her around his friends. When they fought, he told her that she disgusted him. At first, his accusations hit Jan like a sack of bricks. Was she truly so awful, so terrible? Was he seeing something in her she’d hidden even to herself? She become more compliant, more amenable, quieter. Her confidence in herself was shaken. If this man, whom she adored, was disgusted by her, then what did that say about her? Luckily, Jan got help. She spoke with a trusted professional and shared what was going on in her marriage. By speaking about it out loud and hearing her words reflected back to her, she could see that what was going on wasn’t entirely her fault. Her husband’s disgust in her wasn’t a source of personal shame. Rather, it was a wake-up call. When you love someone, their behavior may appall you, but you always love them. You may speak out in criticism of what they’ve done, but your love for who they are stays strong. That’s how Jan felt about her husband, but it wasn’t how her husband felt about her. That’s when Jan’s respect for her husband began to crumble. Six months later, they ended their marriage. “I couldn’t stay married to someone who didn’t respect me,” she explained. “He had no reason to treat me well. Maybe he threw me a bone or two because he was feeling generous, but it really came down to whim. He owned me, and he could do what he liked to me, because he knew I was committed to the marriage and wouldn’t leave.” “But you did leave,” I said. “I did.” She nodded. “I wonder if all marriages end this way. You get to know someone so well that you see all their shadows and dark places, then you stop respecting them, and they stop respecting you.” We sat quietly for a few moments. “Sometimes,” I said, “you see someone’s shadows and dark places, and you love them even more. They become real to you, rather than this god you’ve put on a pedestal. You want to take care of them. It’s like, you want to be the sunshine and rain that composts the crap of their lives into rich, fertile soil.” Jan laughed. “He had a lot of crap, that’s for sure. I just wish he wasn’t so embarrassed of mine.” “Someday,” I said, “you’ll meet someone who won’t be.” Category : Relationships Comments Search for: Recent Posts Can’t Accept It’s Over When Nothing You Do is Good Enough The Death of a Marriage Just Get Over It I’m Right, You’re Wrong Finding love starts within Some images courtesy of Pixabay Click here to contact me.
